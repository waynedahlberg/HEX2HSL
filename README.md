# HEX2HSL

This self-serving app rose out of the need to convert and format HEX color values to a specifically HSL string. Created this macOS application in under 17 minutes to help solve that one-time task. It saved me potential hours today going from website to VSCode to website and manually tweaking the format. All my color picker apps returned a standard HSL format that was unusuable. 

Self-serve software is a thing. Don't know when I'll use it in the future, but saved me hours today.
